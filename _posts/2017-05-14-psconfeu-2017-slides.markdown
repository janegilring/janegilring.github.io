[PowerShell Conference EU 2017](http://www.psconf.eu/) was arranged in Hannover, Germany on Wednesday 3rd to Friday 5th of May 2017.

After the [opening ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0orBEF6D60), Jeffrey Snover held the [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myQkHM_je70) for the conference:

Among the things he talked about is transformational changes, which the path going from traditional IT to DevOps is a great example of:

On the topic of DevOps, I would recommend Kenneth Hansen`s session "DevOps and the Harmonious Whole" where he talks about the upcoming transformation a lot of companies will be going in the coming years. I really loved the following quote which underpins the importance of this topic:

One of the greatest aspects of attending the PowerShell Conference is meeting people from the community. It`s really great to meet familiar faces and names from Twitter and other social media and get to talk to persons you interact with online.
