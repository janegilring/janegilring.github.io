The [Nordic Infrastructure Conference (NIC)](http://www.nicconf.com/) conference was arranged for the 6th time  
in Oslo, Norway on Wednesday 1st to Friday 3rd of February 2017. There was a number  
of great [sessions](http://www.nicconf.com/agenda) being presented by many [industry experts](http://www.nicconf.com/speakers).
