In the past, I've always used Wordpress for blogging. At first, I used a blog account hosted at 
wordpress.com before migrating it to a Wordpress-instance in my Azure MSDN subscriptiopn.
As you might know I've blogged at blog.powershell.no for many years, but on March 4th 2014 I was 
honored to  join PowerShell Magazine as a contributing editor.
Due to that, my PowerShell related articles was being published there going forward. However, I still
need a place to post more personal content such as conference slides & other information.
For a long time I've been thinking about brushing up the design on blog.powershell.no, but as 
I've learned more about GitHub Pages and the simplicity it provides over a full Content
Management System such as Wordpress - I`ve decided to go that route.

As I've been using Git and GitHub more and more over the past years, I've also learned how easy
it is to work with Markdown.

1) Create a repository
Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

2) Clone the repository
Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io

3) Hello World
Enter the project folder and add an index.html file:

4) Push it
Add, commit, and push your changes:
$git add --all
~$git commit -m "Initial commit"
~$git push -u origin master

5) …and you're done!
Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io.


Using Jekyll, you can blog using beautiful Markdown syntax, and without having to deal with any databases. Learn how to set up Jekyll.
